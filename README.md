This project was only a simple setup to try creating a custom driver setup for Selenium Grid and to try creating a custom WebElement class with auto wait for element's interactions.

Because of the reasons above, I will not provide a detailed instructions on how to run the project.

Basically, I used pyenv to install any Python version, Poetry to manage the project's dependencies and docker-compose file for Selenium Grid provided by the Selenium on their repository. Please use their documentation if you want to try this project.
